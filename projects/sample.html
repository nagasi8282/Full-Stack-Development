        <p>Once upon a time, there was a Greek King, Midas.<br>
            He was very rich and had lots of Gold. He had a daughter, who he loved a lot.<br>
            One day, Midas found an angel in need of help. He helped her and in return she agreed to grant a wish.<br>
            Midas wished that everything he touched would turn into gold. His wish was granted<br>
            On his way home, he touched rocks and plants and they turned into gold.<br>
            As he reached home, in excitement he hugged his daughter, who turned into gold.<br>
            Midas was devastated and he had learnt his lesson. Upon learning his lesson, Midas asked the angel to take his wish away.</p>
